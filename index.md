| Time | 8AM - 12PM Eastern Daylight Time | 
| Location | Marriott Philadelphia Downtown |
| Format | In-person workshop | 

The workshop will provide practical information and an enhanced understanding
on how to work with and analyze medical imaging data from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and positron imaging tomography (PET).

The initial portion of the workshop will focus on understanding the basic
structure of an image, how to traverse images, data extraction, and how voxels
relate to world coordinates.

Subsequent lectures will be followed by interactive sessions to demonstrate
simple workflows including tissue segmentation, registration, and
pre-processing steps for fMRI, DTI, and PET. The objective of the workshop is to ensure
participants gain an in-depth appreciation of commonly used interpretive 
clinical and or research applications for each methodology. 

### Target Audience
This hands-on workshop can serve as a beginner or refresher course for 
established investigators, clinicians, and trainees involved in using imaging 
techniques to study Alzheimerâ€™s disease, related disorders and normal ageing. 
Participants from any career stage are encouraged to join, including 
undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and 
assistant professors engaged in clinical practice, research or teaching.

### Requirements
Registrants must bring their own laptops to do the exercises (tablets or 
smartphones will not be sufficient). You will be provided with this repository 
and links to the "Basics of Neuroimaging" series of AAIC webinars. To get the
most out of this workshop, **we strongly recommend that you watch these
webinars ahead of time**. The links to the webinars and the slides are below.

At the workshop, we will all be using a standard environment, using a virtual machine (VM) hosted on the cloud. This ensures that everyone will be seeing the exact same screen for these lessons, regardless of if you are using a Mac or Windows operating system. You can find out more how to access this virtual machine below.

### Agenda
The workshop will consist of hands-on interactive sessions. The first session
will focus on understanding the basic structure of imaging data, how to
traverse images, data extraction, and how voxels relate to world coordinates. 
We will then go through the basic processing steps involving structural MRI 
data, demonstrating simple workflows including tissue segmentation, 
and registration. 

The second half will consist of two independent working sessions, where 
facilitators will present interactive tutorials around different forms of 
neuroimaging analysis (structural MRI, fMRI, DTI or PET data), and the 
participants will then work on the tutorials of their choice, with assistance
from the facilitators. The objective of the workshop is to ensure participants
gain an understanding of how to start processing and analyzing various imaging
modalities used in dementia research.
